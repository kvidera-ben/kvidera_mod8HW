            <h2>About Ben</h2>
            <p>
                I grew up in Polk City, a small town north of Des Moines. I'm a 22-year-old student at the University of Iowa studying Business Analytics
                and Information Systems and will be graduating this May. After graduation, I'll be moving to the Milwaukee area and working for Uline.
                In my free time, I enjoy hiking and kayaking, as well as watching sportsâ€”I'm a big Cardinals fan and a UFC enthusiast. I also got back into reading this semester to reduce the amount of time spent doom scrolling!

            <h2>Why I Chose the University of Iowa</h2>
            <p>
                Ever since I can remember, I was a Hawkeyes fan, so coming to the University of Iowa was an easy choice. I became an Iowa fan out of spite for my brother, who chose to be a Cyclones fan. Additionally, my closest friend 
                growing up was also a big Iowa fan, and we ended up living together for three years until he graduated last year. Initially, I entered the university as a Psychology major with plans to attend law school. However, I soon 
                realized that the subject was boring to me and I had no interest in going to law school, and I transferred to the College of Business. After taking Foundations of Business Analytics, I realized this was the career I wanted to pursue.

            <h2>More About my Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                When I was growing up, my brother and I were always into sports, whether it was watching or playing. When I was younger I played baseball, football, 
                basketball, and ran track. As I got older I specifically spent my time on baseball, as it was the sport I enjoyed playing the most. I am also an avid country
                music fan (my country music playlist is 49 hours long) whether it be listening to some of my favorites or looking for new artists. Additionally, as I said before I am
                getting back into reading. I have started reading the classics-albiet I'm unsure of what determines a book a "classic", I am just referencing Goodreads.
